### *<u>What is Configuration Management Tool</u>*

Configuration Management tool is all about bringing consistency in the infrastructure, by maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state.

With configuration management, you can accurately replicate an environment with the correct configurations and software because you know what exists in the original environment.



#### ***<u>Why Configuration Management Tool</u>***

Suppose you have to modify /etc/host file of a server, what are the chances that you will be making any mistake?
I would say very little, how about if you have to make this change on hundred of servers?
The chances of making misconfiguration increases many times  right....?

This is where the Configuration management tools comes for the rescue. It keeps you away from any 
misconfigurations. This kind of misconfiguration can lead to poor performance, inconsistencies, or noncompliance and 
negatively impact business operations and security. 

Another reason for using Config management tool is that you document each and every change and When documented changes are made across many systems and applications, there are very less scope of any inconsistency or downtime etc.

With the help of Configuration Management tool, we can:

Divide the systems by groups and subgroups, such as Webservers, DB Servers etc
Centrally modify or roll out new settings to these sub groups.
Automate system identification, patches, and updates
Automate the identification of outdated, poor performing, and noncompliant configurations. 
Performa the tasks based on the priority.
Automate the  remediation,  in case of any issue.

#### **<u>Advantages of Config Management Tools:</u>**

Automating configuration management, with configuration management you can maintain the  systems in a desired state.

With configuration management, you make the config changes first on Dev/Test environment, if all goes well you can accurately replicate this over production environment.

With configuration management tool, a configuration management tool can provision a new server within minutes with less 
room for error.

With config management tool, you can improve system recovery by deploying the changes quickly.

Your configuration management tools can also help you to run an audit of your system so you can more quickly 
identify where the problem is coming from. 



We are going to discuss Ansible as config Management tool.

Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates.
