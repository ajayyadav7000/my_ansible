Dictonary vs List vs List of Dictionary


We use Dictonary to store different properties of a single object.
We can have dictonary under a dictonary.

To store multiple item of the same type of the object, we can use LIST.


Dictonary is an un-orderd collection wheras List is an ordered collection

Arrays/List are ordered collection





SPace/Indentation is the key in YAML.
